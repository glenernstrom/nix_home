# My home PC nix configuration

Here is my journey into NixOS: stable, reproducible, declaritive, customizable. As one who works on several computers
during the day, I enjoy having a similar set of tools. I can easily tune each commenting out or adding in
specific modules. I just started using home-manager to manage dotfiles, and I am starting to split out modules to import 
as necessary to my main configuration.nix file. Thanks to [librephoenix](https://www.youtube.com/@librephoenix), 
[vimjoyer](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer), and everyone at [jupiter broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/)
for stoking my interest in this fascinating operating system!
